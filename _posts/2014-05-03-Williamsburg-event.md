### The Disposable Film Festival is really excited to kick off the first of what will be regularly occurring screenings at [Videology] in Williamsburg. This video store/bar and all-around amazing venue is the perfect spot to watch a curated selection of Disposable Films focused on a different theme each month. Of course to start this series off right, our theme will be all things NYC. Hope to see you there!
