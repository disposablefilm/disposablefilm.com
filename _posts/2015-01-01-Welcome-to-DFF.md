Welcome to DisposableFilm.com; the digital home of the Disposable Film Festival. The DFF is dedicated to celebrating short film made using every day technology. As long as it’s innovative, imaginative and non professional we want you to share your films with us so we can share them with the world.

For the last seven years the DFF has been at the centre of a global movement that is redefining what it means to be a film maker and has embraced the democratization of cinema enabled by the tech we have at our fingertips – smartphones, dslr cameras, webcams...even Google Glass.

The festival is held annually at the beautiful Castro Theatre in San Francisco and we take submissions all year round (2015 is open now) as well as holding regular events with monthly competitions and screenings - see you all in Brooklyn!!. The DFF is sent amazing short films from every corner of the world; and submissions from every genre - from animation to documentary, music videos to time-lapse projects – send us your work and see what other people like you are creating. The DFF is judged by an expert panel of independent film makers and writers allowing us to serve as curators to the genre, with so much film out there we want to make sure the best work rises to the top and is celebrated and seen.  We want disposablefilm.com to be for you. To serve as somewhere you can come to learn, share, inspire and be entertained.  Thanks for stopping by.
