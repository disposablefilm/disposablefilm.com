For a decade now, Disposable Film Festival has been a pioneer in bringing the best in “disposable media” from the personal screen to the silver screen. Films featured in the fest have been <a href="http://create.adobe.com/2016/2/26/iphoneography_how_to_make_a_movie_with_your_phone_.html" target="_blank">shot on cell phones</a>, point & shoot cameras, DSLRs, webcams, screen capture software, Flip video cams, and the like. As the technological advances continue to break down the barriers to creativity, with professional features making their way into consumer units and now onto phones, the core tenant of DFF – the use of “disposable media”– makes filmmaking increasingly accessible. 

Selected by Moviemaker Magazine as one of "The World’s Coolest Film Festivals," Disposable Film Festival promotes and supports the next generation of filmmakers to enter and change the industry, through screenings, workshops, competitions, panels, parties, and other events intended to educate and inspire. The program kicks off annually in San Francisco, and is then seen in film festivals around the world throughout the year. 

Adobe is proud to partner with Disposable Film Festival to present <a href="https://workshop.attendease.com/" target="_blank">an inspiring workshop on storytelling</a>. On Saturday and Sunday, April 9 and 10, join us at DFF for a 2-day workshop to learn the ins and outs of video storytelling. On Saturday, April 9, <a href="biancagiaever.com/" target="_blank">Bianca Giaever</a> –a storytelling pro whose work is so great, This American Life's Ira Glass decided he had to work with her– will cover what it takes to craft compelling visuals. On Sunday, April 10, Bronwyn Lewis, Product Manager for Mobile Editing at Adobe, will lead a hands-on workshop that will teach you everything you need to know about Adobe's editing tools, Premiere Pro CC and Premiere Clip, to bring those beautiful clips together into a cohesive story. 

So, weekend warriors: take that mobile movie studio in your pocket, and <a href="https://workshop.attendease.com/" target="_blank">join us on April 9 & 10 in San Francisco</a>!
