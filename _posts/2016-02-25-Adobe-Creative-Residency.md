The DFF is proud to be working with our partner Adobe for another year! 

Both the DFF and Adobe are proponents of the creative work our community does, so we're thrilled to share an awesome program that supports just that! 

Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/about-adobe/creative-residency/being.html" target="_blank">Creative Residency</a> 2016-2017 program gives creative individuals a full salary and benefits for the year, along with resources and relationships to help them with their work. Participating in this program is a great way to pursue and achieve your career goals. 

Applications are open through February 29. The program year begins in early May.

If youâ€™re a filmmaker looking to meet creative folks, make great things, and pursue your dreams, we hope you'll <a href="https://adobecreativeresidency.typeform.com/to/VlJUbp" target="_blank">apply now</a>.
