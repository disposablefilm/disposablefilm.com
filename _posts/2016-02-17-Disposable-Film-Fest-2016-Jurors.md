The Disposable Film Festival is proud to announce its judges for the 2016 program!

Festival judges are composed of artists who have submitted to the DFF in the past, who are making their mark in the film world. Check out some highlights below. 

<a href="https://vimeo.com/benaston" target="_blank">Ben Aston’s</a> no budget short ‘Russian Roulette’ played at Sundance 2015, going on to win the Jury Prize at last year's DFF. 

<a href="https://vimeo.com/cabal" target="_blank">William Caballero’s</a> recent web­series Gran’pa Knows Best, which features 3D printed miniatures of his Puerto Rican grandfather, was licensed by HBO in a first­­time interstitial deal for the network. The DFF showed his film in the <a href="/Disposable-Film-Fest-2015-Winners.html">2015 program</a>.

<a href="http://www.danieldaniel.us/" target="_blank">DANIELS</a> recently premiered and sold their first feature at Sundance, which stars Daniel Radcliffe.

THE NAILS was awarded the Grand Prize at the DFF’s <a href="/2012-competitive-shorts.html">2012 program</a>.
