In 2004, Vimeo was founded by a group of filmmakers who wanted to share their creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, likeminded people discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community of individuals with a wide range of passions. Today, millions of people from all around the world enjoy Vimeo, and we’re growing bigger every day. Come and join the next generation of film makers by using Vimeo Pro to provide a home for your work, to share with your community and maybe even make some money to put towards your next project
