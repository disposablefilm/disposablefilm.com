Let’s say Schindler’s List is your favorite movie. You like Steven Spielberg’s movie so much, you want to recreate your very own little girl in a red dress montage. (Because it’s very subtly symbolic.) Premiere Pro will allow you to recreate that effect. All you have to do is apply the Leave Color effect to your footage – then grab the eye dropper tool, Command/click on the color you want to isolate, add some adjustment – and you got your very own subtle girl in a red dress jumping out from black and white footage.

A similar approach also works if you want to isolate and change a particular color in your footage – using the Change To Color effect. This is a good trick to learn if a certain color in your shot is much too distracting; and you want to take away the focus from it. Keyframe
Change To Color for added fun and imaginative ides.
