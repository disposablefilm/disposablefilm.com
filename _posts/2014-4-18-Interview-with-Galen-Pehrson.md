DFF caught up with Galen Pehrson and asked him some questions about life, the universe and everything about filmmaking and the film he submitted to DFF 2014.

**DFF**: How and when did you become interested in filmmaking?

**Galen**: I began making short films about 10 years ago with 3D animation. The first time I made something move my brain tingled and I was hooked.

**DFF**: What influences your filmmaking?


**Galen**: Concepts that I have trouble articulating, if I can't explain it - it's a good subject to make a film about.

**DFF**: Specifically, what influenced you to make your film that was selected for DFF?


**Galen**: I was watching the Mondo Genre films of the 60's and 70's to fall asleep at night, they're already pretty far out films and I would be falling asleep…kind of slipping in and out of a dream state. I started building a narrative in that half conscious state, which kind of make its way into the films narrative - there's a lot of sort of late night introspection in there.

**DFF**: Why did you want to make this film?


**Galen**: Devendra Banhart had given me the 'Taurobolium' track as a demo when I was working on 'El Gato' with the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, I loved it so much but it didn't fit with this piece, I put it to the side but couldn't get it out of my head…so I decided to write something new specifically around it.

**DFF**: What was the process in making your film?


**Galen**: The film is comprised of 6,240 individually hand drawn and colored frames, the process took 4 months, 12 hours a day.

**DFF**: What kinds of equipment/technology did you use to make your film?


**Galen**: I used  a pencil, paper, a Wacom Tablet and a MacBook Pro. The animation is finalized in Photoshop and TVPaint and composited and edited in Adobe AfterEffects.

**DFF**: Why did you choose to use this equipment/technology in the creating of your film?


**Galen**: Simply put, it's what I have.

**DFF**: How many people did you work with on the making of your film?


**Galen**: I worked with one other animator for about three weeks of the four months, and on the audio side with Rose, Devendra, Noah Georgeson and Thom Monahan.

**DFF**: Did you come across any obstacles while creating your film?


**Galen**: The entire film was an obstacle, I tend to write out scenes and stories I have no idea how to technically make, then just experiment over and over until it looks right.

**DFF**: How do you envision low-budget equipment influencing future filmmaking techniques


**Galen**: I think each technology has its own quirks and features that make it special, when you push equipment to its limits and you start to run up against its limitations you get something unique, it will be interesting to see where low budget film making goes as the lines between consumer and professional equipment get more and more blurred.

Thanks, Galen!
