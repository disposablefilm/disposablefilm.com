**DFF**: How and when did you become interested in filmmaking?

**Michael**: Honest answer…I have no idea. I suppose I could say I’ve always been interested in filmmaking…going to the movies was always one of my favorite things to do growing up. I used to watch movies and mentally place myself in them. I used to be fascinated by not knowing how things on the screen got accomplished. It wasn’t until after college, when I started getting PA gigs, that I actually thought about how to make a film. But I didn’t grow up as a cinephile, knowing the names of directors and producers…I’ve never been a gear head, obsessing over the latest camera and what type of sensor it has. What really got me into filmmaking is the emotional reaction…the feeling that you, as the viewer, have in your gut when you watch something. Pulling out those raw emotions is really what I’m interested in.

**DFF**: What influences your filmmaking?

**Michael**: My background in journalism and literature plays a heavy hand in what I try to accomplish. Story telling is very important to me. Admittedly, I’m not the best oral story teller. I tend to ramble and mumble, get off track and fill in blanks with things that don’t make any sense. But understanding the traits of what makes a story good, and what makes someone a good story teller, absolutely translates across all mediums of story telling…be it oral, written, or visual.

**DFF**: Specifically, what influenced you to make your film that was selected for DFF?

**Michael**: I have an aunt by marriage who is from Cochabamba, Bolivia. She came to the states with my uncle shortly after I was born. She couldn’t speak English, and I couldn’t speak at all, so we were a natural fit for each other. Growing up, I had always heard about this family I had in Bolivia, and had always wanted to travel there to meet them. Finally, a few years ago, I decided to take the trip with my friend and co-producer Stefan Jeremiah. Not wanting to go just for kicks, we researched Bolivian culture and economy, and found that Bolivia is the largest exporter of quinoa in the world.

**DFF**: Why did you want to make this film?

**Michael**: To me, food is a basic human right. We’ve all got to eat, but not all of us do. That really rubs me the wrong way. Bolivia is one of the poorest and malnourished countries in South America yet ironically provides this incredible food which is a perfect protein to the world. Coupled with the fact that quinoa has boomed in recent years in the first world, and that our first world press has published articles claiming how our consumption of quinoa hurts the farmers that grow it…something seemed off to me. I wanted to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, and actually ask these farmers how they were doing.

**DFF**: What was the process in making your film?

**Michael**: All told, we spent about 4 months in Bolivia, spread across 3 different trips. We were able to build our crew and budget with each shoot. The first trip was Stefan and I living in an apartment in Cochabamba in March and April of 2012, going out to quinoa fields on spec, taking photos, and just understanding the lay of the land. After that, we were able to fundraise on Kickstarter. With our successful campaign, as well as private donations, we were able to take a second trip in November 2012, bringing a third crew member with us. Our third trip was in April 2013. That trip was our largest; there were 4 of us on the film crew, as well as some representatives from Fair Trade USA.

**DFF**: What kinds of equipment/technology did you use to make your film?

**Michael**: Most of the film was shot on Canon 5D Mark IIs. We were able to afford to rent a Sony F55 for our third trip. We edited using Avid and were lucky enough to call in favors for color correction and sound mixing.

**DFF**: Why did you choose to use this equipment/technology in the creating of your film?

**Michael**: DSLRs travel well. Bolivia is very very tough to trek across. Most of the quinoa fields are located in the Southwest part of the country, next to the Salar de Uyuni. One has to pack smart and pack light, so our Mark IIs were perfect. Renting the F55 was crucial; Bolivia is one of the most gorgeous countries in the world, and it was important to us that we have as much of a cinematic look as possible. I love low-budget cameras, and will never stop using them. But sometimes DSLRs just aren’t the right cameras to use. That said, dragging that camera across South America without breaking it caused us much anxiety.

**DFF**: How many people did you work with on the making of your film?

**Michael**: A lot! At the end of the day, there was the core group of myself, Stefan, and our editor and co-producer Myke Toth, that were constantly talking about quinoa. But between our Kickstarter donors, translators, fixers, colorist, audio engineer…I’d guess well over 50 people got involved at one point or another.

**DFF**: Did you come across any obstacles while creating your film?

**Michael**: Of course we did. The first obstacle was the fact that I had never really made a film before. Sure, I had worked on sets, been a part of the production process…but I’ve never done the soup to nuts filmmaking before in my life. So the process of making this film, in a way, gave me a Masters degree in filmmaking. Not to say I know everything about filmmaking now…but I certainly know way more than I did when we started. There were the normal financial obstacles, as well. None of us were getting paid to make this film, so we all had to work our normal jobs during production, take time off to travel, have overnight edits, work on weekends, things like that. And then there were the physical obstacles traveling across Bolivia. Much of the countries roads aren’t paved. A day doesn’t go by when someone is protesting something and is blocking the road. The further south you get, the further apart towns are; since the roads aren’t paved, you’re constantly trying to beat sundown for fear that you’ll get lost in between towns. Also, Stefan got stung by a scorpion, which at the time wasn’t funny…but it’s pretty hilarious now.

**DFF**: How do you envision low-budget equipment influencing future filmmaking techniques.

**Michael**: Low budget equipment is going to make it easier to make high quality films. I mean, even with the newest IOS update for the iPhone, you can shoot a time-lapse as well as slow motion. So creative filmmakers will more easily be able to express themselves. With that said, anyone can be a filmmaker with some of the equipment out there. I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing either. There are still those folks who have career aspirations in filmmaking and those who are very good hobbyists. Quality wise, the gap between the two is closing, which means that there is that much more great films out there. It makes it tougher for the viewer to distinguish between a pro and a hobbyist. That forces the aspiring pros to up their game even more and makes the payoff, for both the filmmaker and the viewer, that much sweeter. But at the end of the day, for me, its all about story telling. If you told me a good story, I don’t care what it was filmed with.
