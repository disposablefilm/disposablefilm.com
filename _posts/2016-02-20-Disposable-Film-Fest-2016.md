## FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 2016

### Sound + Vision: A Master Class with Marc Weidenbaum

<b>4:00 PM - 5:30 PM, BAVC IN SAN FRANCISCO</b>

Eyes are forgiving, ears less so. Eyes want to be seduced. Ears are sensitive to incongruity, discontinuity, artifice. How can sound reinforce narrative? How can sound be narrative? How can sound design serve as score? We'll explore the past and the technologically enabled promise of film sound.

Presented by <a href="http://tactiontechnology.com/" target="_blank">Taction Technology</a>.

### PALATABLE PAIRING: FILM AND FOOD AT 18 REASONS 

<b>7:00 PM - 9:00 PM, 18 REASONS</b>

DFF is pairing films with tasty treats from 18 Reasons and Pie Ranch for our signature Film + Food event that delights the intellect as much as the palate! We’ll be serving up bites created by 18 Reasons’ Chef Jaime Tjahaja, made from the freshest organic and seasonal ingredients — along with a selection of the year’s best food films from around the world, courtesy of Real Food Media. And of course a selection of wines from Cycles Gladiator and Broadside to round out the experience.
