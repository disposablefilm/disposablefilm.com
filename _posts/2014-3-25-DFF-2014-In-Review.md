### Opening Night at the Castro Theatre

March 20th 2014. With blue skies over head, crowds gathered, tickets were bought and corn was popped as film fans from far and wide lined up to enjoy the 7th Annual Disposable Film Festival,  selling out the beautiful Castro Theatre yet again. Filmmakers, directors, producers and short film buffs filled the seats to watch this year’s unique program; overflowing with individuality and creativity, all made on everyday equipment proving once again, that films don’t have to be expensive to make a statement.

Despite the word of the hour being ‘gentrification’, we made the bold decision to incorporate a film created on the Google Glass generating some mixed press surrounding the festival.

We were a tad worried this would keep some folks away, but were pleasantly surprised to see people face their fears and show up anyway!

The energy of the audience paired with the wide range of innovative films made the DFF’s 2014 opening night heaps of fun. Thanks to all who made it out!!

### After Party
After the curtains closed and the beautifully handcrafted awards whittled by Jared Rusten himself were distributed, the audience flocked to our favorite studio space, J. Rusten Furniture Studio, for a celebratory after party. Who could resist the promise  Lagunitas Beer and Wente Wines paired with a chance to meet the judges and filmmakers themselves?

### Creativity Workshop: Set your Inner David O. Russell FreeFollowing Opening Night, The Bay Area Video Coalition lent us their cozy rooftop space so our Swedish guests could give us insight into their top-secret Scandinavian creative process. Originators of the two hilarious shorts, SEXY DATA and Dance Motherfucker, Christian, Gustav and Vedran traveled all the way from Sweden to share their one of a kind development method, and gave the audience the opportunity to brainstorm ideas for their latest wacky short.

These boys had amazing energy and passion for their work, which made for an entertaining afternoon full of language miscommunications, ingenuity and excitement. Keep an eye out for more imaginative ideas dreamed up at this awesome workshop in the near future!

The wonderfully rustic J. Rusten Furniture Studio proved to be the perfect space for our partners Pie Ranch, ForageSF, CityBees and Alemany Farm to come together in order to create a menu of deliciously organic and local ingredients prepared by Chef David Stockhausen and his amazing team. Each course was paired with short films focused on urban farming and ways in which we can help solve the problem of “food deserts” in cities, focusing on our favorite city, San Francisco of course!

The intimate dinner was enjoyed by a packed house of passionate audience members, enjoying a delicious ‘home-cooked’ gourmet meal while learning about the importance of urban farming. Who wouldn’t want to be catered to while watching films about the food their consuming? Not to mention the bottomless wine…
### Sunday WorkshopsThe weekend continued on Sunday afternoon at 9th Street Independent Film Center with two amazing panels; Disposable to Sustainable, and Lights, Camera, Social Action! Disposable to Sustainable involved a panel of seasoned filmmakers, tech mavens, and San Francisco Film Society staff giving pertinent advice on how beginners can turn their DIY projects into something bigger, and more long term. Isn’t that every filmmaker’s dream?!

The Lights, Camera, Social Action! panel brought together successful filmmakers, activists and educators hoping to make a difference and raise awareness of a variety of issues through their films. The sheer amount of talent and passion on this panel proved to be extremely inspiring for our audience members. Both of these free events held captivate audiences with committed, aspiring filmmakers looking for advice on how to get their careers started, and how they can use their passion for storytelling to make a difference.
