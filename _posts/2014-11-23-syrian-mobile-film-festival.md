The DFF has always been about the democratization of film but we also believe passionately in the power of everyday citizens to take agency of their own lives by sharing stories that don't usually get played within the mainstream media. On October 15-17 2014 a group of Syrian filmmakers organized a mobile film festival to showcase short films made by citizens, journalists, and Syrians of all backgrounds, on their mobile phones. Often the footage taken on individuals cell phones has been the only information the rest of the world has been able to access from the war torn country. Some of the films are tragic, some are humorous, all offer a glimpse into the everyday existence of human beings whose homes and society have been destroyed through war. The festival is a tribute to those who risked their lives using only their mobile phones to show the world the reality of what is happening within the borders of Syria.

The festival organizers hope this will serve to inspire others to embrace the arts and filmmaking in particular as a means of coping and not losing hope in a seemingly hopeless and frightening situation. Mobile devices have been crucial in shooting two Syrian made documentaries, Silvered Water, Syrian Self Portrait by Ossama Mohammed and Wiam Simav Bedrixan (premiered in the Special Sceenings section of Cannes Film Festival 2014)
 and Immortal Sergeant by Ziad Kalthoum (Official Selection of the Festival del Film Lorcano).

The festivalâ€™s first edition starts on October 15, in five Syrian towns in Syria: Kafranbel, Aleppo, Atareb, Jabal Al-Zawiya and Deraa . There are plans to screen the films in the festival later this year in London, Berlin, and Brussels.
