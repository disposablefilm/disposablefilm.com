###Cell Phones and the Rise of Citizen Journalists have changed the playing field of news coverage

The revolution is not going to be televisedâ€¦it will be tweeted, uploaded, and filmed with cell phone cameras. Mobile phones have brought about the rise of the citizen journalist. With our current cell phone technology, practically everyone has the capacity to take photos, capture video-as well as tweet/share world events in real time. Good damn-it's almost like living in the future.

It's now acceptable for TV news broadcasts to use shaky cell phone video footage to help tell the story of breaking news.  Our citizen journalists-armed with their cell phones-have been instrumental in capturing key components of mainstream news stories-giving a new perceptive that that major network news organizations have neglected to capture. The role of the citizen journalist has opened the playing field on how we view the news. Splinting from the coverage provided by the major networks-news stories now have a much fuller canvas-as coverage is now provided from numerous viewpoints.

With our evolving cell phone technology, let's look at a five major stories that were given a new spin by citizen journalists and their almighty devices.

##The 2009 Iran Presidential Election Protest and the Death of Neda Agha Soltan
Citizen journalists changed our perception of Iran during the 2009 presidential election protests. Twitter, photos, video, and social media proved a pivotal role in bringing the Iranian people together-enabling mass communication around the world despite major government censorship. The death of 27-year old Iranian student, Neda Agha-Soltan-who was killed by Iranian Government security for taking part in a protest in Teheran-became an iconic image of the struggle of Iranian protests-trumpeting to the world the magnitude of violence infused by the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

##The Oscar Grant Shooting
This story hits home: In 2009, 22-year-old Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) police officer on New Years' Day. He was unarmed, handcuffed, and on the ground.  The officer in question claimed that he was reaching for his stun gun--rather than his pistol--when Grant was shot in the back. Several cell phone cameras were whipped out by citizens and captured the incident-the footage was then sent directly to the local news stations. The cell phone footage was used at the trial, and the officer involved in the shooting incident was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. (Though the flimsy two-year sentence caused a major uproar at the state of criminal justice system.)

##U.K. Riots
As we reported on KYC, the growth of the 2011 U.K. riots were brought about in part by the accessibility of social media via smartphones. According to the Guardian: it allowed users to send one-to-many messages to their network of contacts by "BBM PINs." Twitter was preferred by the troublemakers because it enabled them to send encrypted and private messages-such as information on their next target. One BBM message sent called out "everyone from all sides of London" to vandalize shops on Oxford street.
Cell phone footage allowed people around the world to view the riots right from the eye of the storm, such as this video of the T-Mobile store in London being looted-which got over  58,000 views in mere hours:

##The Egyptian Protests
The Egyptian capital of Cairo was the scene of violent chaos earlier this year as tens of thousands of anti-government protesters challenged the 30 year-rule of authoritarian President Hosni Mubarak. The protesters were confronted by police who utilized rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. The 18-day protest finally toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime; navigated by social media and the Internet; which helped to mobilize the masses and successfully deploy a democratic uprising. Without the tools of social media-via cell phones-the demonstrations would never have achieved the global reach it achieved; as shown in this You Tube footage:

##2010 Mosco Metro Bombings
The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were carried out by two suicide bombings during the morning rush hour at two stations. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured. The images of the bomb blast were provided by citizens equipped with cell phones. The rise of citizen journalism gave us different perspectives of the story from people who experienced the tragedy first-hand.
