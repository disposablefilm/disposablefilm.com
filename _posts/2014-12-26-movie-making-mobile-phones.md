  <h3>1. Apple iPhone 6+</h3>
  <img src="{{ 'phones/iphone-6-plus.png' | asset_path }}" width="180" alt="Apple iPhone 6+" align="right">
  <p>Arguably one of the best two or three smartphone cameras on the market today. With iOS 8’s 64-bit architecture, Apple’s A8 processor, M8 motion co-processor and 1920 by 1080 pixels Retina display Apple’s new, 6+ is the real deal. Among the new features an 8-megapixel iSight camera, a 5-element lens with ƒ/2.2 aperture, Autofocus with Focus Pixels, Optical image stabilization, Sapphire crystal lens cover and lots more.  The new iPhone 6+ can now capture 1080p video at 60 fps as well as slo-mo video at 120 or 240 fps. That’s all you need to know.</p>

  <h3>2. Apple iPhone 6</h3>

  <p>OK,  it's not an iPhone 6+ but it’s a terrific new iPhone nonetheless. The 6 has the new, larger 4.7-inch screen and except for optical image stabilization the camera is the same as it is in the much larger 6+. The 6 is smaller and lighter in weight and easier to pull from your  pocket when you’re confronted with that perfect video moment. And, best of all, it’s cheaper than the 6+ phablet. Like it’s big brother it’s very highly recommended.</p>

  <p>The all new, top-of-the-line Android smartphone from Google and Motorola. Its the first to run Android 5.0 Lollipop and now also boasting 64-bit architecture. The Nexus 6 has a 13 megapixel camera with a f/2.0 lens, optical image stabilization and a brand-new Google Camera app which makes it easier to use than previous models. The 6 has a 6-inch screen weighs less than 6-and-a-half ounces and comes with 3 GB of RAM as standard equipment. It should prove to be a terrific package for videographers.</p>

  <img align="right" src="{{ 'phones/lumia-930.png' | asset_path }}" width="150" alt="Microsoft Lumia 930">
  <p>You can look at this handset as either the last phone to come from Nokia or one of the first to come from it’s new owner, Microsoft. The Lumia 930 sports a 5-inch touch screen, runs on Windows Phone 8.1 OS and comes with Nokia’s 20 MP PureView camera system. There’s a six-element, f/2.4 lens, optical image stabilization and a digitial 2X zoom feature. A great camera in a great phone at a decent price. </p>
