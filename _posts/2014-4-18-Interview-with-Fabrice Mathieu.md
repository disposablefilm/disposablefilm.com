DFF caught up with Fabrice Mathieu and asked him some questions about life, the universe and everything about filmmaking and the film he submitted to DFF 2012.

**DFF**: How and when did you become interested in filmmaking?

**Fabrice**: I have been interested in filmmaking since I was sixteen years old. I had watched and loved a lot of films prior to this time, but it was at that age that it became evident that I wanted to make this my profession. So, I began to study in a French Film School and I began making Super 8 films.

**DFF**: What influences your filmmaking?


**Fabrice**: Life, people and great directors! 

**DFF**: Specifically, what influenced you to make your film that was selected for DFF?


**Fabrice**: I can't explain exactly how the idea came for "Dans L'ombre" but I was suddenly inspired by some shadows. It was a particular moment in my life that I found was a perfect time to write a story for silhouettes for heroes. I found the idea to be very interesting and I thinkâ€¦unique in the cinema.  

**DFF**: Why did you want to make this film?


**Fabricew**: First, I wrote a feature script called, "Dans L'ombre". I was interested in telling a story about shadows, and their point of view about us and the world. I immediately envisioned a black and white fantasy movie with a Film Noir style, because this period was the golden age for shadows in the cinema. I finished the script and based on the advice of a few who read it as well as my own thoughts on the subject, I decided to make a kind of trailer. So I began this process and little by little I came to the conclusion that I would make a short film instead of a typical trailer to introduce the idea of the feature. 

**DFF**: What was the process in making your film?


**Fabrice**: "Dans L'ombre" in a Mashup Noir. I used extracts from 56 films and I edited them to best tell my story and to be the most clear in terms of my vision for the feature script. I added some visual effects and all the soundtrack is new.

**DFF**: What kinds of equipment/technology did you use to make your film?


**Fabrice**: I used Final Cut Pro for the editing, Photoshop and After Effects for the sfx. 

**DFF**: Why did you choose to use this equipment/technology in the creating of your film?


**Fabrice**: I've been using Final Cut Pro, After effects and photoshop for a very long time and I'm very happy with all of these tools. I'm very grateful they this technology is around to help me with my film creations! 

**DFF**: How many people did you work with on the making of your film?


**Fabrice**: Only two people: me and Roger Candy for the great deeper voice of the narrator. 

**DFF**: Did you come across any obstacles while creating your film?


**Fabrice**: It was complicated to do because it felt like I was editing a big puzzle. But with time, I was able to find every piece of footage I needed. 

**DFF**: How do you envision low-budget equipment influencing future filmmaking techniques


**Fabrice**: I think that low-budget equipment is the future of filmmaking. Low-budget equipment is already being used in many productions and it also gives everybody the opportunity to make films. This is only the beginning and we can only imagine what will be possible in the future with new technology! 

Thanks, Fabrice!
