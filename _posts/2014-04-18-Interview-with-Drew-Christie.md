DFF caught up with Drew Christie and asked him some questions about life, the universe and everything about filmmaking and the film he submitted to DFF 2014.

**DFF**: How and when did you become interested in filmmaking?

**Drew**: I became interested in filmmaking from watching Empire Strikes Back repeatedly as a young child. Then I started making movies with the family Panasonic camcorder that took huge VHS tapes in the side. I would make movies in our living room with my Star Wars toys on the Ewok fortress. I slowly expanded my area of interest and stopped making star wars fan films.

**DFF**: What influences your filmmaking?


**Drew**: I would say Eastern European and Soviet animators such as Jan Svankmajer, Yuri Norstein, Priit Parn, Jiri Barta, Jiri Trnka, and the Brothers Quay. Also, I am very inspired by the acid westerns such as McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Dead Man and Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid. I'm also extremely influenced by music. British Isle folk music, West African music, American blues and string band music and old time and early country music.

**DFF**: Specifically, what influenced you to make your film that was selected for DFF?


**Drew**: I found it very hard to come up with an idea that was original. So I started researching why this was and found out that it is almost impossible to even state this fact in an original way/

**DFF**: Why did you want to make this film?


**Drew**: I wanted to explore the myth of originality and The New York Times commissioned it.

**DFF**: What was the process in making your film?


**Drew**: I wrote the script (technically Wikipedia wrote the script) and then had some friends read the voices. Then I did a storyboard and some keyframes and started doing all the drawings and then hand painting them all.

**DFF**: What kinds of equipment/technology did you use to make your film?


**Drew**: I used  a pencil, paper, acrylic paint, a scanner, a macbook pro laptop, a wall charger, headphones, a table, a chair, headphones, and adobe after effects and premier pro.7.

**DFF**: Why did you choose to use this equipment/technology in the creating of your film?


**Drew**: I was comfortable with this technique and had done it in the past.

**DFF**: How many people did you work with on the making of your film?


**Drew**: 3 other people besides myself. Spencer Thun to do the music and the voice of the ticketer. Ian Picco to tbe the voice of the patron and Jason Spingarn-Koff from the NYTimes as executive producer.

**DFF**: Did you come across any obstacles while creating your film?


**Drew**: Not that I can think of right now, except for the timeline which was I had to get it done in about 2 weeks.

**DFF**: How do you envision low-budget equipment influencing future filmmaking techniques


**Drew**: I think it will have a huge impact, as it already has. It seems to be a democratizing force, just as Francis Ford Coppola predicted way back in 1991 in the documentary Hearts of Darkness. Ideally, it will make more varied and more interesting films and animations possible.

Thanks, Drew!
