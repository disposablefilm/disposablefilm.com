At the DFF we're all about the democratization of film. We want to help you share your work and find an audience that appreciates your efforts and while it's nice to be liked, it's even better to get paid. So when Vimeo sent us the details for their first original offering through their on demand service we sat up and took notice.

Vimeo is now offering a way for you to get paid by submitting your work to VOD and allowing millions of users to find your film, rent it and enjoy it.  In the next couple of weeks Disposable Film will be integrating the VOD service into our site so you can rent and watch directly. Vimeo's first offering is High Maintenance www.vimeo.com/ondemand/highmaintenance, from Janky Clown Productions, and we love it.

From over worked PAs to overindulged homeless girls High Maintenance takes us on a tour of the hip, the less hip and the downright desperate. Check it out..
