Premiere Pro is the great equalizer and the Fast Color Corrector is one of its generals. Let’s say you want to change the color of your video to set a mood that complements your story – the simplest way is to apply the Fast Color Correct effect to your footage. Want to warm it up for a friendly, happy feel? Then drag in some orange tint? Perhaps you want to cool the footage down to make it spooky - that’s where pulling in the blues comes into play; the more you drag to the edge, the more intense the color will be. Fast Color Correct isn’t the end all of color correction (a little shout out to my friends Three Way Color Corrector and RGB Curves) – but this effect is tres magnifique when you want to do some quick color correcting in a pinch.
