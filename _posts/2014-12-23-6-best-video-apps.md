If you haven’t been living in a cave without Wifi the last few years, you’ll surely know that there are some amazing movie making tools right in your front pocket (if that’s where you keep your smartphone). Obviously, that’s one of the key philosophies of DFF: making movies by any means necessary. Little movie-making phone app trivia: When Searching for Sugar Man director Malik Bendjelloui ran out of money filming his documentary – he turned to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/8mm-vintage-camera/id406541444?mt=8" target="_blank">8mm Vintage Camera</a> app and filmed the rest on his iPhone. Result: A 2013 Academy award for best documentary feature. Yes, movie making apps do pay off.

Let’s cut to the chase; what are the top 5 movie making apps out there (according to me who is writing this article)? It’s a slight subjective question, depending on your tastes – but you certainly wont be disappointed with these apps which will help up your smartphone movie making game:

### 1. <a href="http://www.kinemaster.com/" target="_blank">Kinemaster</a>
Unleash your creativity with an extensible library of various themes and cutting edge special effects. Kinemaster grants you the power of professional video editing in the palm of your hand.

### 2. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-editor-free/id450722848?mt=8" target="_blank">Video Editor FREE</a>
It’s not entirely free – but everyone has to pay the bills.  For a mere 99 cents, you can have a phone editing setup – that’s faster and easier to use than the popular iMovie app. Video Editor For Free (though it costs 99 cents) allows you to trim, merge and share your videos, along with additional snazzy features as recording voiceovers and adding transitions and music from iTunes.

### 3. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/action-movie-fx/id489321253?mt=8" target="_blank">Action Movie FX</a>
You know you’re going to get something cool from a special effects app created by JJ Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot. Action Movie FX allows you to add Hollywood-style action movie visuals to your videos – missile attacks, car smashes, avalanches, and, of course, spider strikes. Another plus: An intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface is easy that makes it brilliant fun. Did I mention it’s free?

### 4. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/stop-motion-studio/id441651297?mt=8" target="_blank">Stop Motion Studio</a>
Stop Motion Studio lets you take photos and thread them together to create stop-motion works of art. Create your very own Wallace and Gromit – right on your phone. The free version allows you to add music and narration. Purchase upgrades have such nifty features as green screen, paint tools and sound effects.

### 5. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cine-meter-ii/id846918884?mt=8" target="_blank">Cine Meter II</a>
Do you know how much a good light meter costs? I don’t –but I can only imagine that it's a lot. But for a mere $19.99, you can download Cine Meter II: a cinematographer's spotmeter with an RGB waveform monitor and a false-color picture. The app is not quite pro-level, but it will do when you’re in a pitch…or on a budget.

### 6. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r-de-rec/id528642521?mt=8" target="_blank">RØDE Rec</a>
Here’s a blessing for low-budget productions – that can’t afford expensive radio mics; for $5.99 – you can get your ideas out there.
Rode Rec is a broadcast-quality audio recorder for your phone, and it works great when paired with a lapel mic.  The app features a suite of audio editing tools.
