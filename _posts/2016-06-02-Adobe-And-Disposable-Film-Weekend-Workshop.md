Adobe partnered with the Disposable Film Festival to present an inspiring Weekend Workshop on storytelling as part of DFF 2016, held in San Francisco. We brought 25 filmmakers of all levels together at the <a href="http://www.sffs.org/filmmaker360/filmhouse" target="_blank">San Francisco Film Society's Filmhouse</a> for a 2-day workshop to learn the ins and outs of video storytelling.

We kicked off Day One with <a href="http://biancagiaever.com/" target="_blank">Bianca Giaever</a> –a storytelling pro whose work This American Life’s Ira Glass decided he had to hire her after seeing her amazing films Scared is scared and Holy Cow Lisa  Bianca covered what it takes to craft compelling narratives, solicit great audio and how to combine it all with striking visuals to create unforgettable stories. In the true nature of Public Radio, her stories get to the very heart of what life is all about.

Day Two was lead by Bronwyn Lewis, Product Manager for Mobile Editing at Adobe. She took a hands-on approach that walked attendees through bringing those beautiful clips together into a cohesive story using Adobe’s editing tools, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" target="_blank">Premiere Pro CC</a> and <a href="http://c00.adobe.com/v3/ff5f6e84ecfaffe36767dd1cee903fda1b88a4300f6ec67008aa5e7de726687e/start?a_i_id=919399401&a_g_id=com.adobe.premiereclip&a_dd=i&ctxa.referrer.campaign.name=Disposable+Film+Fest+2016&ctxa.referrer.campaign.trackingcode=DFF-16&ctxa.referrer.campaign.source=DFF+Media&ctxa.referrer.campaign.medium=Email-Website-Social" target="_blank">Premiere Clip</a>.

The best part of the weekend? Seeing these 1 minute films come to life. The Filmhouse is located in the middle of Chinatown – offering filmmakers endless opportunities for grabbing unique content. Simply walking down the street, or grabbing lunch, easily provided them with captivating subject matter. Being able to utilize <a href="http://c00.adobe.com/v3/ff5f6e84ecfaffe36767dd1cee903fda1b88a4300f6ec67008aa5e7de726687e/start?a_i_id=919399401&a_g_id=com.adobe.premiereclip&a_dd=i&ctxa.referrer.campaign.name=Disposable+Film+Fest+2016&ctxa.referrer.campaign.trackingcode=DFF-16&ctxa.referrer.campaign.source=DFF+Media&ctxa.referrer.campaign.medium=Email-Website-Social" target="_blank">Premiere Clip</a>, Adobe’s mobile app for video editing, filmmakers could capture everything on their mobile device – in true DFF fashion. Anyone could shoot, easily edit on the spot, and take it all the way through to Premiere Pro on the desktop for fine tuning.

We can’t wait for what’s in store next year!
