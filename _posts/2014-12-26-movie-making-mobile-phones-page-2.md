  <h3>6. Microsoft Lumia 1520</h3>
  <img align="right" src="{{ 'phones/lumia-1520.png' | asset_path }}" width="150" alt="Microsoft Lumia 1520">
  <p>In this case this year-old Nokia handset is still a monster. It was the first with a 6-inch, full HD (1920 by 1080 pixels), IPS touchscreen as well as the 20 MP PureView camera with a top-notch Zeiss lens. Runs on the Windows Phone OS. This phone is big and it's not really made for one-handed operation. But it is a great shooter. And it’s only $99 with an AT&T contract. </p>

  <p>The S5 sports a 16 megapixel shooter on the back which is also capable of capturing 1080p video. Add in the beefy quad-Core Snapdragon processor and 2 GB of RAM into the equation and you have yourself a top-class smartphone/camera system. Reviewers say the S5 camera more than holds its own against competition like the iPhone 5S and HTC One(M8). Samsung's new Android flagship is available virtually everywhere.  </p>

  <h3>9. HTC One(M8)</h3>
  <img align="right" src="{{ 'phones/htc-one-m8.png' | asset_path }}" width="230" height="320" alt="HTC One(M8)">
  <p>This HTC flagship phone is still terrific and the camera is pretty amazing. Do not be fooled by the lack of published specs. HTC doesn't subscribe to the “my camera has more megapixels than your camera” theory. Instead, HTC claims the One's “UltraPixel” camera has larger pixels than the competition. Forget the war of words – the One has a great shooter which handles 1080p video with aplomb. The One (M8) is available from the four major phone carriers and directly from HTC.</p>
