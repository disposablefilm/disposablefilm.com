Welcome to 2015! DFF Brooklyn is upon us once more and as usual we're very excited about our next screening at Videology in Williamsburg on Friday, February 6th from 8:30pm - 10:30pm. Our last event saw a packed house as we ran waaaay over time to show some of the best submissions from the last few years so come down early to get a good spot. If you have a film you'd like to submit please send your film and details to <a href="mailto:caitlin@disposablefilm.com">caitlin@disposablefilm.com</a>.

Admission is FREE! See you there :).
