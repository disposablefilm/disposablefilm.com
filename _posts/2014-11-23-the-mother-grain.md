One of the things we value about being able to shoot with the camera in our pocket and share with the world is that issues are brought to the public's attention that would normally go unheard, little corners of the planet that were previously hidden have been exposed, injustices highlighted and important developments effecting human lives are addressed.

One such film from film maker and NY resident Michael Wilcox does just that with his first documentary The Mother Grain. It's about Bolivian quinoa farmers and how our consumption of their product affects their lives. We asked Michael about why he wanted to make the film:

"To me, food is a basic human right. We’ve all got to eat, but not all of us do. That really rubs me the wrong way. Bolivia is one of the poorest and malnourished countries in South America yet ironically provides this incredible food which is a perfect protein to the world. Coupled with the fact that quinoa has boomed in recent years in the first world, and that our first world press has published articles claiming how our consumption of quinoa hurts the farmers that grow it…something seemed off to me."
