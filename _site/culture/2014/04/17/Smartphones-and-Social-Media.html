Smartphones have created and ended comedy careers. In the age where everyone has a computer/video camera in their pocket, smartphones and social media – are both enhancing and ruining live comedy.
</p>

<p>
The easiest example in the con-column, is the plain rude assholes who sit in the front row and text their friends while standup shows are in progress.
(Don’t even get me started about people who forget to turn their phone ringer off.) The immediacy of blasting out misquotes and out of context material on social networks has literally ruined comedian’s careers.
</p>

<p>
On the pro-side, performers in remote regions have become comedy superstars – by making a grand splash on YouTube through their webcams. Formally, comedians had to live in a major city to get a big break – now it can be done by being innovative and having a massive Web following. (That’s just what happened to that pint-sized comedy singer, Justin Bieber.)
</p>


<p>
Comedy is an ever evolving process; comedy clubs used to be a safe haven where a performer could get on stage, work out material, and have the creative license to take a chance with the risk of failing; the routine was a present moment experience that wouldn’t go beyond the room.
</p>

<p>
Now, in 2014, a joke-in-formation uttered by a comedian runs the risk of being broadcast on YouTube - and blasted out on the Twittersphere. Smartphone cameras have hurt comedians’ development of material, as fans post unauthorized YouTube videos before comics wish to share the material with the entire world.
</p>

<p>
Example: Chris Rock stands firm that smartphones are ruining comedy:  “The sad thing, with all this taping and stuff, no one’s going to do stand-up,” Rock stated. “And every big stand-up I talk to says: ‘How do I work out new material? Where can you go, if I have a half an idea and then it’s on the Internet next week?’”
</p>

<p>
Rock references his infamous “Niggas vs. Black People” routine – from his 1996 Bring the Pain standup special; which he estimates took six months to hone and perfect. (Imagine the early days of that routine.)
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
“You know how racist that thing was a week in?” Rock said. “That’s not to be seen by anybody.”
</p>

<p>
Rock said he would perform more often in small comedy rooms - if he did not fear that fans would post video recordings of his sets: “I’ll go back to comedy clubs when they get a real no-camera policy, the same way they did with smoking.”
</p>

<p>
The casebook example of a comedian’s career ruined by a cell phone video is Michael Richards. His off-the-cuff racist rant captured at the Laugh Factory – and blasted out on YouTube – put the nail in the coffin of his post-Seinfeld career. By no means am I saying being racist is funny (comedy is always the weak taking on the powerful), but when we (the public) see an out-of- context video on YouTube - we have no idea what went on before or after a two-minute racist rant that went viral around the world. (My theory is Richards was trying to be “edgy” like hack Carlos Mencia – and horrifically failed. After all, the sign does say, “Comedy Club.”) To quote British comedian Stewart Lee, “Social media is Big Brother manned by a citizens brigade.”
</p>

</p>

<p>
Another prime example is Dave Chappelle’s show last year in Connecticut – where he stopped his performance after being heckled. Chappelle went on unannounced at the gig so he could work out new material. After getting annoyed by an onslaught of requests to do his Rick James impersonation, Chappelle left the stage. When the video was posted on YouTube, the media jumped to the conclusion that the comedian was having a meltdown:

<p>
Okay, so far I’ve been pretty much a <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">downer</a> about the attributes of smartphone and social media culture – but let’s look at the other side of the YouTube coin in our modern DIY culture. Musical comedian, Bo Burnham, came out of complete obscurity to become a major force in comedy. He’s had his own Comedy Central special, starred in the MTV series, Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous, and recently released his first book of poetry.
</p>

<p>
He achieved fame when his YouTube videos took off and received more than 124 million views, which in turn, got him signed to a four record deal with Comedy Central Records. Burnham's videos were self-recorded in and around his family's home in Hamilton, Massachusetts; mostly in his bedroom. Burnham rarely changed camera angles while performing on his home-produced videos – he simply set his video camera on a stack of books; to give his productions a "do-it-yourself feel - almost like voyeurism.
Check out one of Bo’s first videos – filmed from his bedroom – and garnishing a mere 8.5 million videos. (He looks like he’s about ten years old):
</p>

</p>

<p>
The DIY culture also launched the career of Andy Samberg – and cemented a place for the comedian on Saturday Night Live – with his comedy musical group, The Lonely Island. Beginning in junior high school, Samberg and partners Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone, began filming live skits and comedy musical parodies; which caught the attention of MTV and were invited to write portions of the 2005 Movie Awards. Host Jimmy Fallon brought the trio to the attention of Saturday Night Live producer, Lorne Michaels. And the rest is discovered-because-of-YouTube-video history.
Look what The Lonely Island was up to back in 2001 with their first attempt at a sitcom format:
</p>

</p>

<p>
Conclusion: Smartphones, social media, and DIY videos have the means to make and break comedy careers. Live comedy is just that; a live event. Daniel Tosh’s rape joke and Tracy Morgan’s homophobic routine both gained a mainstream media frenzy when their acts when their jokes were paraphrased on Twitter. Meanwhile, performers are being plucked into the mainstream by posting videos filmed from their bedrooms. It’s the best of times, it's the worst of times.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to smartphone culture and social media, as they say in the Spiderman movie (or one of the Spiderman movies, at least): With great power comes great responsibility.
