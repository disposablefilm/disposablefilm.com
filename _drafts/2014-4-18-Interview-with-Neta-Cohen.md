DFF caught up with Neta Cohen and asked some questions about life, the universe and everything about filmmaking and the film he submitted to DFF 2013.

**DFF**: How and when did you become interested in filmmaking?

**Neta**: I was interested in films and filmmaking since I was a child, but decided I wanted to create my own films, only when I was in my final year at the Bezalel Design Academy. I had to work on my graduation project, and felt like a film would best reflect my point of view at the time...

**DFF**: What influences your filmmaking?


**Neta**: My filmmaking is mostly influenced by design - I design first, and direct later. I always look for happenings that will make interesting visuals, before I think of cinematic moments...

**DFF**: Specifically, what influenced you to make your film that was selected for DFF?


**Neta**: This film is a long sequence of associations, metaphors for current 2.0 culture. I was influenced by a lot of things and people - George Perec, M.C. Esher, David O'reilly, Japanese Origami, the DADA Manifesto, and the list goes on…

**DFF**: Why did you want to make this film?


**Neta**: I wanted to create a massive amount of visual and sound stimulations, and decided and animated film would be the best way to go. I was also interested in experimenting with stop motion animation, and it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do that.

**DFF**: What was the process in making your film?


**Neta**: As my film is a non-narrative, my process was a bit different than usual - I conceptualized and made a list of all my scenes I planned. I shot each scene, and then edited it in order to create the animation. After all the scenes were animated, I edited all of them together.

**DFF**: What kinds of equipment/technology did you use to make your film?


**Neta**: I used mostly paper and a little but of plasticine to create the models, a Canon 600D to shoot the stop motion scenes, and three lights to illuminate the sets. I created the actual animation using "Dragoneframe", and did all the color corrections, compositing and editing with Adobe Photoshop, AfterEffects and PremierePro.

**DFF**: Why did you choose to use this equipment/technology in the creating of your film?


**Neta**: I choose the equipment and technology I felt most comfortable with, and within my low budget limits…

**DFF**: How many people did you work with on the making of your film?


**Neta**: I worked with my partner, Lior Ben Horin, who was responsible for the compositing and VFX, and did some of the editing. I also worked with Markey Funk, who created the soundtrack.

**DFF**: Did you come across any obstacles while creating your film?


**Neta**: I had a great time creating my film, but I experienced a lot of difficulties, as I had a very short period of time to make it (about 4 months), and it was my first attempt at Stop motion animation. In addition, as it was my graduation project, I had a lot depending on it, and it make me stress out even more. :)

**DFF**: How do you envision low-budget equipment influencing future filmmaking techniques


**Neta**: I think that nowadays, theoretically, everyone can become a filmmaker very quickly. This means low budget cinema can only evolve and thrive, but it also has its downsides - we tend to produce large quantities of everything, and not always of the greatest quality…
I think we need to keep an eye for our creation, and cultural habits, to make sure we both make and consume great things, whether low budget or worth tons of money…


Thanks, Neta!
